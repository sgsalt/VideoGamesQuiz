# Video Games Quiz

This was my submission for the Quiz project on the Android Basics Nanodegree at Udacity. The main aim is to to include a variety of interactions, in this case radio buttons, checkboxes and text fields. There's also a score button that calculates the number of correct answers and gives a specific response.
