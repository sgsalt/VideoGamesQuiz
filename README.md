# Video Games Quiz

Android Basics by Google Nanodegree Program

Project: Quiz App

The goal is to create an educational app that quizzes a user about a certain topic of your choice.

A simple quiz app using a variety of interactions about the topic of video games. The app will calculate a score and give a different toast response depending on what responses you gave.

TODO on this project: Apply a visual overhaul and add more questions.
